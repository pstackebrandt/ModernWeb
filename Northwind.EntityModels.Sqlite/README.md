# Northwind Entity Models for SQLite

This project contains the Entity Framework Core models for the Northwind database
using SQLite as the database provider.

## Database Setup

The Northwind database file (`Northwind.db`) is not included in version control but
can be easily recreated using the provided SQL scripts.

### Prerequisites

- SQLite3 command-line tool
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Entity Framework Core tools (`dotnet ef`)

### Create the Project

```ps
dotnet new classlib -n Northwind.EntityModels.Sqlite -f net9.0
```

Add project to solution:
```ps
dotnet sln add .\Northwind.EntityModels.Sqlite\Northwind.EntityModels.Sqlite.csproj
```

### Create Northwind Database

From the solution root directory, run:
```ps
sqlite3 Northwind.db -init .\scripts\sql-scripts\Northwind4SQLite.sql
```

This command:
1. Creates a new SQLite database file named `Northwind.db`
2. Executes the SQL script to create tables and populate data
3. The database will be created in the solution root directory

### Generate Entity Models

After creating the database, generate the Entity Framework Core models:

in Northwind.EntityModels.Sqlite folder:
```ps
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Data Source=../Northwind.db" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --namespace Northwind.EntityModels --data-annotations
```

This command scaffolds C# model classes and a DbContext from the existing database.

I got this output:

To protect potentially sensitive information in your connection string, you should move it out of source code. You can avoid scaffolding the connection string by using the Name= syntax to read it from configuration - see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2131148.

The column 'BirthDate' on table 'Employees' should map to a property of type 'DateOnly', but its values are in an incompatible format. Using a different type.

The column 'HireDate' on table 'Employees' should map to a property of type 'DateOnly', but its values are in an incompatible format. Using a different type.

The column 'Extension' on table 'Employees' should map to a property of type 'decimal', but its values are in an incompatible format. Using a different type.

The column 'Fax' on table 'Suppliers' should map to a property of type 'decimal', but its values are in an incompatible format. Using a different type.

The column 'OrderDate' on table 'Orders' should map to a property of type 'DateOnly', but its valuelues are in lues are in an incompatible format. Using a different type.

The column 'RequiredDate' on table 'Orders' should map to a property of type 'DateOnly', but its values are in an incompatible format. Using a different type.

The column 'ShippedDate' on table 'Orders' should map to a property of type 'DateOnly', but its values are in an incompatible format. Using a different type.

The output shows several warnings about data type incompatibilities when scaffolding the SQLite database. This is actually somewhat expected behavior when working with SQLite, particularly with date-related fields.

Here's why:
Date Fields: SQLite doesn't have native date/time types. Instead, it stores dates as TEXT, INTEGER (Unix timestamp), or REAL. The warnings for BirthDate, HireDate, OrderDate, RequiredDate, and ShippedDate are common because SQLite's date storage format doesn't directly map to .NET's DateOnly type.
Numeric Fields: The warnings for Extension and Fax fields suggesting they should be decimal but are in an incompatible format is also typical for SQLite, as it might be storing these values in a format that doesn't directly map to .NET's decimal type.
This behavior is normal when working with SQLite databases, especially with the Northwind sample database which was originally designed for SQL Server and then ported to SQLite.
To improve this situation, you could:
- Create custom value converters for the date fields to properly map between SQLite's storage format and .NET's DateOnly type
- Modify the database schema to ensure numeric fields are stored in a format compatible with .NET's decimal type
- Accept the default type mappings that EF Core chooses (likely string for some fields and DateTime for dates)
```
