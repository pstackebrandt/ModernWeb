### Bugs in WebAPI
- [x] Call to customers of a country returns empty list if the country is not found.
  - Example: https://localhost:5151/customers/in/Germany
  - Expected: A list of customers from Germany or an error message that the country is not found.
  - Actual: An empty list., Url: https://localhost:5151/customers/in/germany
    - Remarkable: Country name was changed to lower case
  - Call to UK works: https://localhost:5151/customers/in/UK, casing not changed
  - Solution: Use ToUpper() in Program.Customer.cs to compare the country name
