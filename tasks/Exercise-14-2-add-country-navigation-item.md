## Task
- [x] In Northwind.Blazor project, in NavMenu, call customer's web service to get list of country names
- [x] Loop through country names
- [x] Create menu for each country

## Steps
- [x] Describe the task
- [x] Implement the design - Too easy, just copy the code from the book.
- [x] Test functionality
- [x] Plan optimized design
- [x] Comment the code

## Design

## Design Optimization

## Solution
Prototyping:

Optional Optimization:
- [ ] Too many country entries in menu => Show them on a separate page, in dropdown or in a multiple-column layout
- [ ] CSS styling is bad: Longer country names need 2 lines and have a big vertical
      space between the lines. At the same time is the menu entry background static.
      That's why, the names do not fit into the menu entry background and entries look broken.
